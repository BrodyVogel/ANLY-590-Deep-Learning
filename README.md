Repo for ANLY 590 (Deep Learning and Neural Networks)

Assignment 0 is a statistical learning refresher.
Assignment 1 is full of theory-based exercises to demonstrate an understanding of neural network architecture, optimization algorithms, etc.
The notebooks are scripts we've built / gone over in class.
